Process: I wrote up all the functions of the board one at a 
time and tested them afterwards. I build the board using the main method.
For example:
        //Test Code
        System.out.println("Making Board:");
        GameBoard myBoard = new GameBoard(7);
        System.out.println("Printing Board:");
        System.out.println(myBoard);
        myBoard.addShip('A', 'c', 'A', 'g', 'A');
        myBoard.addShip('D', 'B', 'b', 'B', 'B');
        System.out.println(myBoard);
        System.out.println(myBoard.print('S'));
        System.out.println("Printed.");
From there I build the functionality up to get user input. Once the game
seemed to be working from there I added the error handling and the reading
of files in. Then I worked to test and make sure that the output matched the
example given on the website. From there I made sure to get all the errors
that the prompt wanted us to have.

In an attempt to break commandlines I would fire at the same location
in the water or at ships and make sure the stats increased for misses.
I would attempt to fire at locations that were too far or send additional
arguments to certain calls.

After user commands were sufficiently tested I went on to try breaking
the program with bad Sample files to make sure the errors worked propperly.

H d I D
F C f d
Description: Testing the exact same input as the example shown online but with upper and lower case characters.
Result: Runs how it should. Tested by issuing the exact same commands as in the test example.

Description: One of the ships wants to be placed on the 'Y' coordinate. Tested with a board that is 25 x 25. Ship places. Tested with a board that is anything less and it will not work and throws error that it is out of bounds.
